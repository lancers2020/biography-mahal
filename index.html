                        Born on 19<sup>th</sup> of December, 1989, at Sto. Tomas Davao del Norte, Liuwe Rosel Angway or most commonly kown as "Mahal" from her peers has always been inclined with music
                        ever since in her early years. At her early age of 2 years old, she already memorized all the countries in the world, and at age of 4, she started playing the violin, and, later on,
                        the piano. Growing up until her college days has been smooth transitioning from being a music genius to an academic varsity. She have had a  lot of difficulties when it comes to dealing with roaches, as most teenage girls do.
                        And this was the time she first started inventing her very first scientific project supported by her university â€” Harvard University. Up until now she is mostly busy with her daily schedule that if anyone
                        would want to set an appointment with her, it would at least cost them a lot of money (innumerable).<br/> favorite color is brown.

Tomas National High School was the second lucky middle school to be selected by "Mahal", performed great feats and secured noble achievements not just for herself, but for the school too. And, her parents, which are always there like the ever proud parents they are. Lucky bastards.
                        And yes, you sure guessed it right, VALEDICTORIAN (12 sections).<br/>
                        In College, she is giving the honor of attending her college academic years at Sto Tomas College of Agriculture, Sciences and Technology with her course "Bachelor of Science in Office Administrations".
